The Hilo Game

Description: 
  This is a card game, where the dealer will deal one card. The player can then decide if the next card dealt will be higher or lower than the next card. The dealer will then deal a new card and if the card is higher and the player chose higher, the player's score will raise 100 points. If the next card was lower and the player chose lower, the player will receive 100 points. When the player's choice is incorrect, the player will lose 75 points. The game ends when the user has 0 points or chooses to not play again.
